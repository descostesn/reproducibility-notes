- "Obtaining the same results using the same data and same code is “reproducibility”."
- " If code is different, it is “robustness”"
- "If we used different data but with the same code, it is “replicability”"
- "Last, using different data and different code is referred as “generalizability”."
- "Tackling irreproducibility in bioinformatics thus requires considerable effort beyond code and data availability, an effort that is still poorly recognized in the current publication-based research community."
- "we were able to test the robustness of the method with our Python implementation. However, this took approximately two months for a senior researcher and six months for a master student."
